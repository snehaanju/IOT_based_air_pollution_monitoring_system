# IOT_based_air_pollution_monitoring_system
• In this project we are going to make an IoT Based Air Pollution
Monitoring System in which we will monitor the Air Quality over a
webserver using internet and will trigger a alarm when the air quality
goes down beyond a certain level, means when there are sufficient
amount of harmful gases are present in the air like CO2, smoke,
alcohol, benzene and NH3. It will show the air quality in PPM on the
LCD and as well as on webpage so that we can monitor it very easily.

• we have used MQ135 sensor as the air quality sensor which is the
best choice for monitoring Air Quality as it can detects most harmful
gases and can measure their amount accurately. In this IOT project,
you can monitor the pollution level from anywhere using your
computer or mobile
